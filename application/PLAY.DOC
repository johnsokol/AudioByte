A Little History...
-------------------
           June 8, 1991 Zebra Research becomes a real company by offering
        it's first product "Audio Byte", a digital sound playback dongle
        for the IBM PC Parallel Port.  The release was warmly welcomed
        by local buyers interested in digital sound on the PC. The package
        included "SPLAY", playback software and more than 2 megs of sound.
           July, 1991 Release 1.10 now included Software written by
        Mark J. Cox, "MODPLAY" and "PLAY".
           August, 1991  Mark J. Cox  Agrees to let Zebra Research Agrees
        to use "PLAY" and it's code, as long a version remains available
        in the PUBLIC DOMAIN.

PLAY v4.20                                                      02-24-92
by ZERBRA RESEARCH
Original Code by Mark J. Cox


        How it works?
        -------------
        PLAY is a combination command line playback and sample program,
        it is also a full screen INTERACTIVE editor. This software
        written entirely in A86 assembely is both powerful and compact.
        The features include:

                Wide range of playback and sample rates 5-44 kHz
                Supports both mouse and keyboard commands
                Built in HELP on buttons
                FAST Zoom and Unzoom of sound samples
                Two types of post filtering
                Automatic support for Amiga and Atari sound files
                Includes a small Sampling digitizer
                Includes standard type editing functions
                Includes unique editing features like reverse

                NEW FEATURES
                ------------
                Keyboard keys for buttons now make more sense.
                8kHz button added 16kHz eliminated.
                New upper playback rate of 44kHz.

        To see which bugs were fixed and added use the internal button
        "BUGS".


        What you'll NEED
        ----------------
        For the Command line mode (explained below) all you will need
        is an IBM PC computer (or compatible).

        For the Interactive mode (also explained below) you will need
        a VGA monitor and a mouse.

        We recommend at least an AT-PC (286) machine with a clock speed
        of about 10mHz or better. You may also want one of our
        AUDIO BYTES to playback sound thru the printer port(LPT1).
        We also recommend a Hard Disk and an extended keyboard.
        And, of course, the more memory the better.


        Starting PLAY.
        --------------
        Starting PLAY can be done one of two ways, using the COMMAND LINE
        MODE you type the program name followed by a blank space followed by
        the name of a sound sample (the file name of the sound sample).
        Here is an example:

        C:\SOUND>PLAY BART.SND

        PLAY will play the sound sample BART.SND at the default speed (11kHz)
        throught the default port (LPT1).

        NOTE: THE COMMAND LINE VERSION IS NOT RELIABLE I PROMISE TO FIX IT
              BY THE NEXT RELEASE.

        Starting PLAY in the INTERACTIVE MODE can be done one of two ways
        type PLAY with no parameters or the PLAY with the interactive
        switch. Here are some examples:

        C:\SOUND>PLAY

        C:\SOUND>PLAY /i


        Exiting PLAY.
        -------------
        If you are in the command line mode, PLAY will stop on it's own
        when done, unless you are recording.
        If you are in the interactive mode, located in the upper right hand
        corner is the QUIT button. Depress the Quit button and confirm
        the exit in the popup dialog box by pressing the NEW QUIT button.
        To exit quickly hit the "q" twice on the keyboard.



        COMMAND LINE MODE OPTIONS
        -------------------------
        I did not have time to really fix the command line problems, but
        I promise to have a new interface on the next release.
        Here are the options and how they work, the best I know.


        Usage: PLAY [/k<nn>][/l<n>][/option] [<filename>]

        k<nn> = Select Play/Record speed in kHz (default 11kHz)
        l<n>  = Specify what hardware port to use (/l? for list)
                (SEE BELOW)

        s                Play <filename> through PC speaker (Lo-Fi)
        p                Play <filename> through D>A hardware (Hi-Fi)
        r                Record sample and save as <filename> with preview
        e                Listen to sampler input with echo
        v                Displays version information and compiled options
        i (or no option) Invokes Interactive version of PLAY

                Port options are:
                l1  Printer port one (LPT1) on most systems
                l2  Printer port two (LPT2) [is LPT3 on a PS/2]

                lP  Prototype adaptor board (Base address 0300h)
                lV  Printer port one (LPT1) on video board of a few systems


        INTERACTIVE MODE
        ----------------
        The Interactive mode is where I have spent most of my time and
        here it is.

        The interface (what makes is go between you and the computer)
        is mainly mouse driven, but every screen button (just about) has a
        corresponding keyboard button to do the same thing.

            The MOUSE and doing something.
            ------------------------------
            To use the mouse simply position the screen pointer
            (the musical notes) over the button you wish to activate,
            then press the left mouse button.
            Here is how:

            ---------------------------
            To get help with the mouse simply position the screen pointer
