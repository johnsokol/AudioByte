SPLAYER v1.00                                              02-24-92

Code by John L. Sokol


        How to it works?
        ----------------
        SPLAYER is digital sound playback program for the internal
        speaker. This a Public Domain subsitute for our SPLAY module
        released for our AUDIO BYTE.  SPLAYER is complete compatible
        with our commercial Sound Implementation SPLAY.  This utility
        offer programers and hackers alike a platform for not only
        developing application but, along with PLAYIT and PLAY (the
        digital sound editor), but great tools to impress your friends
        and associates.
        The features include:

          .Wide range of playback and sample rates 5-44 kHz.
          .Supports all IBM PC types (8086,80x86).
          .Accepts most all PCM(1) sound formats
             (Sound Blaster-VOC,Macintosh,Amiga,SGI,etc.).
          .Uses the PC's own internal speaker(2).
          .Uses six bits playback
             (some others use five on the internal speaker).
          .Uses an advanced algorigthm to sound good at any sample rate.
          .Does NOT crash on a old type PC (the original 4MHz machine).

          NOTE: If you are familiar with our SPLAY.exe it is
                very compatible with it.
                (1) PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) is a very common method for
                    storing analog signals (like sound) to a digital format.
                (2) Some Laptops use Piezo buzzered, they don't work like
                    a speaker, so they sound scratchy (actually, horibble).
                    For the adventourious hackers replacing the speaker
                    will solve the problem (At your own risk!!)


        What you'll NEED
        ----------------
        You will need an IBM PC computer (or compatible) with an internal
        speaker.

        We recommend at least an AT-PC (286) machine with a clock speed
        of about 6MHz or better. You may also want one of our
        AUDIO BYTES to playback sound thru the printer port(LPT1).
        A monitor of some sort, MDA, CGA, EGA, or VGA, would be nice.
        We also recommend a Hard Disk and, of course, the more memory
        the merrier.

        NOTE: SPLAY and SPLAYER do work on the old (4MHz) IBM PCs, but
              on the higher sample rates it may not sound correct.
              SPLAY does a far superior job on the old (4MHz) PCs, I
              would strongly suggest you get a dongle to really hear
              the difference.



        Starting SPLAYER.
        -----------------
        Starting SPLAYER can be done at the COMMAND LINE, by typing
        the program name followed by a blank space followed by
        the name of a sound sample (the file name of the sound sample).
        Here is an example:

        C:\SOUND>SPLAYER BART.SND

        SPLAYER will play the sound sample BART.SND at the default
        speed (22kHz) throught the internal speaker.


        Exiting SPLAYER.
        ----------------
        When you are in the command line mode, SPLAYER will stop on
        it's own when done.


        Command Line Options
        --------------------
        To get HELP enter SPLAYER at the commandline
        without any parameters and you will get help.
        Order is important for SPLAYER, make sure to leave
        the sound file name for last, the other parameters
        must preceed it.

        Synopsis: SPLAYER [options] soundfile

        Options are:

        -S (Sample rate parameter) from 0 to 9
                  0 = 44000 Hz  |  5 = 8000 Hz
          Default 1 = 22000 Hz  |  6 = 7000 Hz
                  2 = 16000 Hz  |  7 = 6500 Hz
                  3 = 13500 Hz  |  8 = 5500 Hz
                  4 = 11000 Hz  |  9 = 5000 Hz

        -V Verbose (Causes text output)
                NOTE: Errors will always be displayed

        EXAMPLE: SPLAYER -S4 -V C:\SND\COKEISIT.SND
                 will play file COKEISIT.SND at 11 KHZ



                Sample Rate Parameter
                ---------------------
                To use the "S" parameter correctly follow it
                immediately by a number parameter between
                0 (zero) and 9 (nine).  Zero is the highest
                playback speed parameter and Nine is the lowest
                playback speed.  The speeds are listed above.

                Verbose Parameter
                -----------------
                SPLAYER usually does it's work quietly, to get
                more message on your screen use the "V" parameter.
                This parameter is useful is you are unsure of
                what SPLAYER is doing at any one time. It is also
                useful if you want to see our name.
