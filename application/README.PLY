What you'll NEED
----------------
You will need a VGA monitor and a mouse. We recommend at least an AT-PC (286)
machine with a clock speed of about 10mHz or better. You may also want one
of our AUDIO BYTES to playback sound thru the printer port(LPT1). We also
recommend a Hard Disk and an extended keyboard. And, of course, the more
memory the better.
